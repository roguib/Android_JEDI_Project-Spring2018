# Android JEDI Project
This was my first project working with Android. As one of my friends named is a "swiss knife" project, just because it contains different elements with varely any relation.

## Content
The app has the following elements:
- Log in/Sign in
- Calculator
- Memory card game with a ranking storing the time needed for different users in order to solve the puzzle
- Local music player

Also, for the sake of learning, we added things such as toasts, snakbars and local notifications.

## Requeriments and execution
- Android 27 or lower
- Android studio to compile and execute the app on an emulator

1. Clone this repository on your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/roguib/Android_JEDI_Project-Spring2018.git
```
2. Open the project's folder with Android Studio and follow the instructions detailed in the [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/ "Android Documentation") on how to run and execute an app.

## What I have learned
A lot of things, to mention some of them:
- Basic elements of an Android App such as main activites, fragments, intents, shared preferences and other stuff
- Android studio enviroment and basic UI/UX design
- How to think, structure, programm, debug and improve the code
- How to publish an app to the Play Store

## License and some considerations:
Feel free to read, use or modify all or part of my work without giving me any credit at all. This activity was the final project for an extracurricular course I took during my summer holidays at my university.
